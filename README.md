# MacOS Automator Workflows

Updated 2018-09-27

## Overview

[Automator](https://macosxautomation.com/automator/) is an application bundled with MacOS that allows you to save time by automating repetitive, time-consuming tasks. 

This page details services I've developed that you can install and use on your own Mac.

Some examples include:
* Splitting and combining PDFs
* Batch resizing images
* Converting a PDF into images
* Looking up a highlighted word using the Dictionary app
* Counting highlighted words

![Example Workflow](./Images/Resize.png)

You can perform all these actions without even opening applications. Just right-click (control-click) a file or folder, and valid operations will be found in the Services menu. The services work system-wide, including in Finder and text areas.
